** Zero-Knowledge Verification System **

Detailed idea proposal for my team.

# The Problem

Students surrender massive amounts of personal information just to get
basic discounts. To prove “I’m a student” for a \$5 Spotify discount,
you must upload your driver’s license showing your full name, exact
birthdate, home address, photo, and more to companies like SheerID.
These companies store this data in centralized databases that become
targets for breaches. The main issue is that verifiers need one bit of
information(e.g. “is this person a student?”) but current systems
require exposing dozens of data points.

# Our solution

Students receive digitally-signed credentials from our service. Our
service gets the information about the user via OAuth or SAML. These
credentials are stored encrypted in a browser wallet. When verification
is needed, the wallet generates a zero-knowledge proof, a cryptographic
proof that demonstrates credential validity without exposing any
credential contents.

For example: Instead of uploading your full student ID, you generate a
mathematical proof that says “I have a valid credential signed by an
accredited university AND it hasn’t expired.” The verifier learns only
“this person is currently a student.” They don’t learn your name, which
university, your graduation date, or anything else.

The innovation here is that the credential stays on your device, only
the proof gets sent to the verifier.

# Architecture

1.  Issuer(our service): Authenticates students via university OAuth,
    creates and signs credentials, and immediately sends credentials to
    student’s browser. We do not store credentials or student personal
    data.

2.  Holder(student): Stores credentials encrypted in broswer wallet,
    generates zero-knowledge proofs when needed, controls when and where
    to share proofs.

3.  Verifier(Spotify, Intellij, etc): Receives proofs, verifies them
    mathematically, grants access without seeing personal data.

Data flow: Student authenticates with university -\> university confirms
enrollment via OAuth -\> our services creates signed credential -\>
credential sent immediately to the student’s browser -\> student stores
in a wallet -\> when verification is needed, generates proof from
credential -\> sends proof to verifier -\> verifier checks proof
mathematically -\> grants access/discount.

## What to research

1.  Circom - a DSL(Doman-specific language) for writing
    ZK(Zero-Knowledge) circuits. Circom files compile to WASM, C++, and
    JS. Those files will be needed to create proofs. I think we will
    have one circuit per feature. So for student verification 1 circuit.
    For age verification another circuit. I suggest going through
    **[circom documentation](https://docs.circom.io/)**.

2.  Snarkjs - a JS library for creating and verifying proofs. I will
    also have to research this one a bit deeper.

3.  Arkworks - a Rust library that can also create proofs and verify
    them. But this is for server-side since rust doesn’t run in
    browsers.

4.  W3C Verifiable Credential - a credential format also research what
    “did“(Decentralized identifier) is. Here’s **[the
    documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/)**. But I
    think it’s better to let the AI explain it to you.

5.  Deployment. The easiest setup would be AWS ECS + Fargate. Use AWS
    KMS to manage keys.

6.  Infrastructure: Terraform/Opentofu.

7.  CI/CD: Github actions. Duh we are “forced” to use github.

8.  Language + Framework to implement the domain logic. I will probably
    create a poll.

9.  Frontent will probably be written using some JS framework(but we
    will 100% use typescript). We should also decide on that. Also I am
    still not sure about how the wallet would work. I don’t know whether
    it should be a browser extension or a separate website.

10. For signing the credentials, we will probably use Ed25519.

11. OAuth/OIDC how to do authentication via university’s IDP(Identity
    Provider). We will have to figure out how to do it. If it doesn’t
    work we will have to create a dummy idp(also verify if it is
    feasible).

## THREEEEEE MAIN QUESTIONS

1.  Is it useful/usable? It will be using the interface we build whether
    it is a browser extension or a website.

2.  Is it valuable? I think so. I must not be the only one who passed on
    gemini and cursor deals because they asked for an ID.

3.  Is it feasible? Creating one service in one semester? Seems feasible
    to me.
