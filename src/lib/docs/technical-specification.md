# Product Overview (The “What”)

**Problem Statement:** Existing identity verification systems require
users to disclose entire credential documents (student IDs, driver’s
licenses) to prove a single attribute, creating unnecessary privacy
exposure and centralized data liability for verifiers. ZeroVerify allows
circuit-defined attributes (“I am an enrolled student,” “I am over 21”)
to be cryptographically proven without revealing any underlying personal
data.

**Target User:** The primary persona is an end user (student,
individual) who holds a digitally-issued credential and needs to
selectively prove specific attributes to third-party verifiers
(merchants, services, platforms) without exposing their full identity.
Secondary actors are institutional identity providers (universities,
employers) whose OAuth/OIDC infrastructure ZeroVerify delegates to for
attribute verification during issuance, and verifiers (merchants,
services) who integrate ZeroVerify’s open-source SDK to
cryptographically validate proofs.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features:**

- **Credential Issuance:** ZeroVerify authenticates the user via the
  institution’s OAuth/OIDC IdP, generates a W3C Verifiable Credential
  containing the user’s attribute set, signs it with a BBS+ signature,
  and delivers the signed credential to the user’s client for local
  storage.

- **Proof Generation:** The user’s client runs a ZeroVerify-provided
  zk-SNARK circuit against their locally-stored credential. The circuit
  derives a boolean claim (e.g. “over 21”, “is a student”) from the
  credential’s attribute set, producing a proof of that claim without
  revealing the underlying attributes. If the credential does not
  contain the data required by the circuit, proof generation fails. No
  credential data leaves the device.

- **Proof Verification:** A verifier uses ZeroVerify’s open-source SDK
  to validate the zk-proof against the issuer’s published verification
  key and checks credential revocation status against a
  publicly-accessible W3C Bitstring Status List that ZeroVerify hosts on
  S3. The cryptographic validation runs entirely on the verifier’s side
  with no round-trip to ZeroVerify’s infrastructure.

# System Architecture (The “How”)

## System Diagram

## Architectural Boundary

ZeroVerify is a library and issuance service, not a verification
intermediary. The system provides: (1) an issuance API that issues BBS+
signed credentials, (2) a client-SDK that handles credential storage and
proof generation, and (3) a verification library that verifiers embed.
Verifiers interact directly with users. They only call ZeroVerify to get
a W3C revocation bitstring.

## The Tech Stack

**Backend: AWS Lambda (Rust)**

The credential issuance service is implemented as a serverless Lambda
function behind the API Gateway. Lambda is appropriate here because
issuance is a stateless, event-driven operation with low baseline
traffic and unpredictable spikes during enrollment periods. A persistent
server (EC2 or ECS) would be over-provisioned at idle and require
operational management that adds no architectural value for this
workload. Lambda’s per-invocation billing and automatic scaling match
the issuance traffic pattern.

Rust was chosen over Java or other runtime options because Lambda cold
start times are critical for issuance responsiveness (target \< 800ms
total execution). Rust Lambda functions have significantly faster cold
starts ( 100-300ms) compared to Java ( 1-3s) and lower memory footprint.
Since issuance operations involve cryptographic operations (BBS+
signing) where memory safety is critical, Rust’s compile-time guarantees
eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities without runtime overhead.
The BBS+ signature library ecosystem in Rust is mature, and Rust’s
zero-cost abstractions ensure the 6-7.5ms signature operation target is
achievable without JVM garbage collection pauses.

**Database: AWS DynamoDB**

Credential metadata is stored in DynamoDB. The access pattern is
entirely key-value.

**Revocation Storage: AWS S3**

The revocation bitstring (a Bitstring Status List per the W3C spec) is
stored as a static object in S3 and replicated globally using S3 Cross
Region Replication (CRR). The bitstring is small (1 bit per credential)
so CDN is not justified.

**Client SDK: TypeScript**

The proof generation library that runs entirely in the browser. The
library fetches needed keys from ZeroVerify.

**Infrastructure/IaC: Terraform/OpenTofu**

Infrastructure is defined as code for reproducible deployments and
CI/CD.

## External APIs & Integrations

**University OAuth 2.0/OIDC IdP**

Used during credential issuance to authenticate the user and fetch
authoritative attribute claims (enrollment status) from the IdPs”
endpoint.

**AWS Secrets Manager**

The BBS+ issuer private key is stored here, since AWS KMS does not
support BBS+ as it is not a NIST-standardized algorithm.

# Data Design

## Core Entities

List the 3–4 most important data objects:

- Users

- Proofs

- Credentials

## Proof Entity Schema

```json
{
	"proof_type": "age_over_21",
	"proof": "base64_zkSNARK_proof_bytes",
	"public_inputs": {
		"challenge": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
		"credential_status_index": 94567
	}
}
```

## Credential Entity Schema

```json
{
	"student_id": "G89u28394",
	"email": "anton@oakland.edu",
	"first_name": "Anton",
	"last_name": "Sakhanovych",
	"birthdate": "2000-05-15",
	"custom_claims": {
		"student_status": "enrolled",
		"enrollment_date": "2021-09-01",
		"university": "Oakland University",
		"major": "Computer Science"
	}
}
```

## Data Schema

**Relationships:**

- One user can have multiple different credentials. Specifically, they
  can draw their credentials from different sources (e.g. University,
  Job, Government). However, they will only have one unique
  `idp_unique_id`.

- One user can generate many different proofs

- Each signed credential can be used to generate many proofs

**Credential Metadata Table:**

```json
{
	"subject_id": "did:key:z6MkF5rGMoatr...",
	"credential_id": "https://api.zeroverify.com/credentials/a3f8b2c1-4d5e-6f7a-8b9c-0d1e2f3a4b5c",
	"credential_type": "Student_Credential",
	"issued_at": "2025-02-10T20:41:27Z",
	"expiresAt": "2026-02-10T20:41:27Z",
	"revocation_index": 94567,
	"revoked": false
}
```

## Storage Strategy

The files will be stored in AWS S3 and metadata about issued credentials
will be in AWS DynamoDB.

# Technical Complexity & Depth

## The “Hard” Part

**Integrating with existing Authentication protocols**

OAuth/OIDC protocol variability: institutions use different
implementations with varying standards compliance, attribute formats.

**Designing Efficient and expressive zk-SNARK circuit**

Designing circuits that prove boolean claims (e.g “Over 21”, “is
student”) without revealing any underlying attributes.

**Revocation consistency and batch processing**

The core challenge is preventing race conditions when multiple Lambda
functions concurrently process revocation requests. For example: 1000
users generate revocation requests → SQS queue batches them (100
requests/batch) → lambda reads S3 bitstring, modifies bits for all 100
requests, write back to S3. However, concurrent lambda invocations
reading and writing the same S3 file create race conditions where
revocation updates can be lost or overwritten. The solution is
implementing optimistic locking or atomic update mechanism to ensure all
revocation bit flips are captured under high concurrency.

# Resilience & Security

## Error Handling

- If the OAuth IdP fails or times out, the system returns HTTP 503 and
  prompts the user to retry.

- If the revocation list cannot be retrieved, the system denies
  verification rather than approving the proof.

- The system implements a circuit breaker approach:
  - After repeated external API failures, requests temporarily fail fast
    instead of waiting for long timeouts.

  - The system retries after a cooldown period.

- ZeroVerify follows a fail-safe policy: verification is never approved
  if validation cannot be fully completed.

## Security

- All communication between users, verifiers, and ZeroVerify uses HTTPS
  (TLS 1.2+).

- Server-side data (DynamoDB and S3) is encrypted using AWS KMS.

- ZeroVerify does not store raw PII after credential issuance.

- Credentials are stored locally in the user’s browser and are not
  transmitted to ZeroVerify unless generating a proof.

- Each proof is bound to a verifier-provided session nonce to prevent
  replay attacks.

- Session identifiers expire after a fixed time window (e.g., 5
  minutes).

- The verification API validates:
  - Proof structure

  - Cryptographic validity

  - Issuer signature

  - Revocation status

- IAM roles follow least privilege principles.

- API keys and signing keys are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and are
  never hardcoded in source code.

- The system never returns “valid” if verification fails or is
  incomplete.

# Milestone Roadmap (The “When”)

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Prototype Implementation

### Infrastructure + Database Schema + Issuance Skeleton (API endpoints)

- Set up basic infrastructure so the demo can run end-to-end (frontend +
  backend running).

- Create the minimal database schema needed for the demo (credential
  storage + proof session/challenge tracking).

- Set up Keycloak identity middleware (login/authentication) and connect
  it to our backend.

- Stand up the issuance API skeleton (endpoints exist and respond):
  - POST /api/credentials/request (start issuance)

  - POST /api/idp/mock-login (mock IdP auth)

  - POST /api/credentials/issue (issue/store credential)

### Trusted Setup (required before credential generation + proofs)

- Run a trusted setup to generate the setup parameters/files needed for
  our circuits so credential-related proof generation and verification
  can work.

- Deploy verification and proving key to the S3

### Credential Issuance Flow

- Backend generates the credential and returns it to the web app, and
  the credential is stored locally in the user’s browser

- The user clicks “Request Credential” on our web app to start issuance.

- Create a mock verifier.

### Replay Protection (session nonce/challenge binding)

- Generate a unique session challenge (session nonce) per verification
  attempt and bind it to the proof (handled as part of the circuit).

- Demo check: attempt to reuse an old proof in a new session → should be
  rejected.

### Proof Generation + User Consent (at least 1 proof type)

- Proof request is shown in our web app and the user must approve/deny.

- On approval, generate a proof for one proof type (ex: student status
  or over 21).

### Verifier Verification Flow (Accepted/Rejected) (last step)

- Verify proof using issuer public key + public inputs.

- Return Accepted/Rejected and log basic non-PII debug info.

## Phase 4 (Week 4-6): Hardening + UI + Testing

Goal: Done by April 13

### Error handling + clear rejection reasons

- Add clear rejection reasons: **invalid**, **malformed**, **revoked**,
  **expired**
  - **Invalid:** proof doesn’t verify

  - **Malformed:** missing/wrong format

  - **Revoked:** credential was disabled

  - **Expired:** session/challenge/credential expired (if applicable)

### Revocation checking (if in scope for demo)

- Add a revocation check during verification

- Demo case (if implemented): revoked credential → rejected

### UI polish for demo flow

- Simplify the demo screens and prompts
  - clear “Approve/Deny” consent step

  - clear “Accepted/Rejected” result screen

### Testing plan + test cases

- Happy path: request → approve → proof generated → verify → accepted

- Failure cases: replay attempt, malformed input, invalid proof (and
  revoked/expired if implemented)

## Phase 5 (Week 7-Finals): Final Checklist + Demo Prep

### Deployment/demo packaging + documentation cleanup

- Decide demo format: hosted or local run

- Create simple “how to run” steps so any teammate can launch the demo

- Cleanup documentation so it matches what we actually built

### Final deliverables prep

- Finalize website/video (if required)

- Lock demo script + slide updates (who presents what, demo steps)

### Final product demo (Finals Week)

- Final rehearsal + backup plan (in case something breaks)

- Deliver final demo during finals week

# Limitations and Tradeoffs

**Credential Revocation**

We implement _[W3C Bitstring Status
Lists](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/)_ rather than PKI
mechanisms (CRL/OCSP) because bitstrings preserve verification privacy.
_[CRL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280)_ requires
merchants to download lists of revoked credential identifiers, creating
linkability.
_[OCSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol)_
requires real-time queries with credential identifiers, exposing
verification patterns. Bitstrings encode revocation as bit positions in
a compressed list; merchants fetch the bitstring, check the relevant bit
locally, reveal nothing about which credential they’re verifying. Users
self-revoke by generating ZK proofs of credential ownership. Time-based
expiration handles normal lifecycle without revocation overhead.

**Proof Generation Cost**

Generating ZK Proofs takes 2-5 seconds on modern devices. This is more
compute-intensive than submitting a SheerID form. However, it is faster
than uploading the document and waiting for manual approval. The
computational cost shifts from servers to user’s device.

**Browser Security vs Apple’s hardware wallet**

Browser-based credentials storage is less secure than Apple’s secure
element. However, our architecture never transmits the credentials.
Credentials always stay on the device, and only ZK proofs are sent. Even
if someone compromises browser storage, they get only one user’s
credentials, not a centralized database of millions. Apple’s approach is
more secure, but their selective disclosure still sends identity data.
We trade hardware-level security for zero data disclosure.

**Trust**

Merchants trust our mechanism through cryptographic verification, not
reputation. The ZK proof is mathematically verifiable using our public
key; if it verifies, the credential was genuinely issued by us and
hasn’t been tampered with. We issue credentials only after OAuth
confirmation from the authoritative source; the issuer is the source of
truth, not us. Merchants can audit our public key and verification code
for transparency. SheerID offers broader coverage through _[200,000+
data
sources](https://www.sheerid.com/press-releases/sheerid-expands-identity-verification-platform-with-marketing-hub-and-dataconnectors-to-400-martech-solutions/)_
but requires collecting excessive user data. We offer cryptographic
certainty with zero data collection. Initial adoption requires pilots
with privacy-conscious brands.
