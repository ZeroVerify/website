## Executive Summary

### The Hook

Over 17 billion personal records were compromised in 2023 alone
(Flashpoint 2024 Global Threat Intelligence Report). The dominant
identity verification protocols in use today, SAML, OAuth, OpenID
Connect, are designed to transmit full identity attribute sets rather
than selective proofs of individual claims. An organization verifying
student status receives a name, institutional affiliation, date of
birth, and email address because that is what the protocol delivers.
There is no native mechanism for a verifier to request only what a
transaction requires and receive only that. When systems built on these
protocols are breached, the exposed records reflect everything the
protocol required them to collect. ZeroVerify attacks the collection
requirement itself.

### The Problem

Current digital identity verification operates on a structural mismatch
between what verifiers need and what protocols deliver. To confirm a
single boolean claim (“Is this a person a student?“), SAML, OAuth, OIDC
return a full attribute assertion containing every identity field the
institution has on record. Once the transmission occurs, the user has no
mechanism to limit how the data is used, how long it is retained, or
whether it is deleted at all. No existing system integrates
zero-knowledge proofs into standard OAuth 2.0 and OIDC flows such that a
verifier can confirm a claim about a user’s identity without receiving
any personal attributes at all, and without requiring organizations to
replace their existing identity infrastructure.

### The Solution

ZeroVerify is a privacy-preserving identity verification layer that
integrates with the identity infrastructure universities and enterprises
already operate. It addresses the structural problem of attribute
over-disclosure not by minimizing what is shared, but by eliminating
attribute disclosure entirely from the verification event.

The system works in two phases. In the issuance phase, ZeroVerify
federates with an institution’s existing IdP via Keycloak acting as an
identity broker. The institution requires no modification; from its
perspective, Keycloak is a standard service provider. ZeroVerify’s
issuance layer extracts the verified attributes from the claims set and
produces a BBS+ signed verifiable credential, which is delivered to and
stored in the user’s mobile wallet. The raw credential never leaves the
device after this point.

In the verification phase, a verifier issues a challenge requesting
confirmation of a specific boolean claim, for example “Is this person
over 21?” or “Is this person an active student?” The user’s wallet uses
the stored credential as a private witness to a zk-SNARK circuit
specific to that claim type. The circuit produces a cryptographic proof
that the claim is true without encoding any attribute value in the proof
output. The verifier submits this proof to ZeroVerify’s library, which
checks cryptographic correctness, confirms the challenge nonce has not
been previously consumed (preventing replay attacks), and checks the
credential’s revocation status against a W3C Status List bitstring. The
verifier receives a single result: valid or invalid. No name, no
birthdate, no institutional affiliation, no personal data of any kind is
transmitted to the verifier at any point in this flow.

The integration boundary is deliberately placed so that neither the
institution nor the verifier needs to understand or adopt zero-knowledge
proof systems. The institution speaks SAML, OAuth, OIDC. The verifier
calls two SDK functions. ZeroVerify handles the cryptographic complexity
in between.

### Technical Approach

ZeroVerify is built on four core technologies: BBS+ signatures for
credential issuance, Groth-16 zk-SNARKs compiled in circom for circuit
definition, Keycloak as a SAML/OAuth-to-OIDC broker, and snarkjs for
client-side proof generation. The backend runs on AWS Lambda and
DynamoDB Global Tables across three regions, with W3C Status List
revocation state stored in S3.

The technical challenge is composing zk-SNARKs and BBS+ signatures into
a system that speaks the protocols universities and enterprises already
operate, SAML, OAuth, OIDC, without requiring those institutions to
change anything on their end. Keycloak bridges that gap as
SAML/OAuth-to-OIDC broker, normalizing heterogeneous institutional
identity systems into a consistent claims surface that ZeroVerify’s
issuance layer can sign into verifiable credentials. The second hard
problem is that proof generation must run entirely on the user’s mobile
device, because sending the raw credential to a server for proof
generation would defeat the privacy guarantee. This requires compiling a
Groth-16 zk-SNARK prover to WebAssembly and executing it client-side
within the constraints of mobile hardware.

### Impact

ZeroVerify has implications across three dimensions. Economically, it
targets markets where identity over-disclosure is endemic: the student
discount market ($19.3B by 2033) and age verification market ($1.2B by
2028), where users currently surrender full identity documents to prove
a single attribute. Legally, GDPR and CCPA both mandate data
minimization; ZeroVerify satisfies that requirement at the protocol
level rather than through organizational policy. The EU’s May 2024
digital identity regulation explicitly requires zero-knowledge proofs,
which independently validates the technical approach. Socially, users
stop surrendering identity documents for routing verifications. The
credential stays on the device. The verifier learns one bit: valid or
invalid.

## Product Definition

ZeroVerify is a privacy-centered verification platform that lets users
confirm eligibility claims, like student status or age requirements,
without exposing unnecessary personal information. The system is
designed to reduce identity data exposure while still providing secure
and reliable verification for online services.

ZeroVerify integrates with trusted Identity Providers (IdPs or Keycloak)
through standard authentication protocols. After a user signs in, the
platform receives verified information needed to issue a credential,
then issues and signs that credential and delivers it to the user for
local storage.

When a verifier requests verification, the request maps to a specific
**proof type**, which corresponds to a specific **circuit** that
ZeroVerify supports. The circuit determines exactly what becomes public
versus private in the proof, meaning the user is not choosing arbitrary
attributes to reveal. Instead, the user reviews the requested proof type
(circuit) and either approves or denies generating that proof. The
verifier receives a simple Accepted/Rejected result and does not gain
access to the user’s full identity data.

Overall, ZeroVerify focuses on data minimization, user consent at the
proof-type level (circuits), and compatibility with existing identity
systems.

## Target Audience (Primary users + pain points)

**Primary: Verifiers (merchants, websites, service providers)** who need
to confirm a single eligibility claim (ex: student status, over-21) but
do not want to collect or store personal identity data.

Pain points:

- Existing verification methods often require collecting full identity
  attribute sets even when only one yes/no claim is needed.

- Storing identity data increases breach risk, compliance burden, and
  long-term liability.

- Manual verification or document uploads are slow, high-friction, and
  easy to abuse.

**Secondary: End users (students/individuals)** who want to prove
eligibility without oversharing personal details.

Pain points:

- Users are forced to share more personal info than necessary for simple
  checks.

- Users have limited control over how long a verifier retains their
  data.

**Supporting: Institutions/IdPs (universities/enterprises)** that
already run identity infrastructure and prefer solutions that do not
require major changes.

Pain points:

- They do not want to replace or rework existing SAML/OAuth/OIDC setups
  to support selective disclosure.

## User Goals (What they are trying to achieve)

**Verifier goals:**

- Confirm an eligibility claim with a simple result (valid/invalid)
  during a real-time flow.

- Reduce the amount of personal data they collect, store, and are
  responsible for.

- Prevent reuse/replay of verification attempts and reduce fraud.

**End user goals:**

- Prove a claim (student/over-21) without revealing unnecessary personal
  attributes.

- Understand what is being requested and approve or deny before proof
  generation.

- Complete verification quickly with minimal steps.

**Institution/IdP goals:**

- Support verification using existing identity infrastructure without
  new protocol changes.

- Avoid adding additional identity-data distribution pathways.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

For the initial launch/demo, ZeroVerify will support one end-to-end
verification flow with at least one proof type (e.g., student status).

**Core requirements and features:**

- **Issuance via existing IdP (Keycloak broker):** User authenticates
  through an institution IdP via Keycloak, and ZeroVerify issues a
  signed credential.

- **Credential storage in user wallet:** Credential is delivered to the
  user and stored in their wallet/client (not stored centrally as raw
  identity data).

- **Verifier challenge + proof request:** Verifier requests a supported
  proof type and sends a fresh challenge.

- **User consent:** User reviews the request and approves/denies proof
  generation.

- **Proof generation (supported proof type):** User generates a proof
  for the requested proof type.

- **Verification result:** Verifier receives a clear valid/invalid
  result.

- **Replay protection:** Proof is bound to the verifier challenge to
  prevent reuse across attempts.

- **Revocation checking (if included in demo scope):** Verification
  includes a check against credential revocation status.

  - Verifier ID

  - Unique Challenge

- The request is delivered to the user’s wallet

### User Consent & ZK proof

- Wallet displays requested attributes

- If user declines, the system returns consent_denied

- If user approves:
  - A ZK proof is generated tied to verifier challenge

### Proof Verification

- Verifier submits the ZK proof + challenge + Public input

- System checks:
  - Proof Structure is valid

  independently

- The system should include operational logging and monitoring to
  support debugging and maintenance without logging PII

- The system should allow policy updates (e.g., supported proof types,
  replay protection rules) without requiring major redesign

## UI/UX & Design Strategy

### How the user interacts with the logic

ZeroVerify’s UI is designed around a simple “start → login → consent →
result” flow. The user should always understand (1) what they are
proving, (2) what is being shared (yes/no), and (3) when the action is
complete. The UI emphasizes privacy and consent so users never feel like
verification is happening “in the background.”

### Conceptual Model (the mental map we want users to have)

We want users to think of ZeroVerify like a digital yes/no stamp, not an
identity-sharing process:

1.  Get credential (login once with your institution through
    Keycloak/IdP)

2.  Review request (a verifier asks for a specific proof type like
    “student status”)

3.  Approve/Deny (user controls whether the proof is generated)

4.  Result (verifier receives Accepted/Rejected; user sees confirmation)

Key message shown in the UI:

Style goals: simple, professional, low-stress, privacy-first.

- **Colors:** neutral but fun background, one main accent color for
  primary actions, clear message for Accepted/Rejected

- **Typography:** large headings, readable body text, consistent
  spacing, consistent font

- **Layout:** single-purpose pages with clear titles (Select University,
  Login, Consent, Result)

Reusable components (used across screens):

- Primary/secondary buttons (Start, Continue, Approve, Deny)

- Cards (request summary, consent details, result panel)

- Status badges (Accepted/Rejected/Processing)

- Alerts (error + reason, warnings like “request expired”)

- Loading states (spinner + short message)

### Feedback Mechanisms (instant signals)

Users should always get immediate feedback that something is happening:

- Loading spinner + message for “Redirecting to login…” and “Generating
  proof…”

- Clear success state: “Proof sent” / “Verification complete”

- Clear rejection state: “Rejected” with a short reason label

- Disable buttons during processing to prevent double-clicks

- Optional sound/animation is not required; visual feedback is enough

### Error Handling (minimize confusion and mistakes)

We reduce user mistakes by making the next action obvious and preventing
“oops” clicks:

- Before action: clear labels on what’s being requested (proof type) and
  what is shared (yes/no)

- During action: confirmation prompt before sending proof (consent
  screen)

- After action: show a short reason if something fails, using plain
  language

Example error messages (plain language):

- “Request expired — ask the verifier to try again.”

- “Invalid request format — please retry.”

- “Verification failed — proof could not be validated.”

- “Credential revoked — this credential is no longer valid.”

Prevent slips:

- Simple page flow, minimal choices per page

- Big buttons + spacing (Approve/Deny separated)

- Consistent wording (always “proof request” or always “challenge,” but
  not both in the UI)

## Technical Constraints & Data

Ensuring the project is technically feasible.

### Data Models

Define clear relationships (1:N, N:N) and primary keys.

**Credential Table Schema:**

|                  |                            |               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Attribute**    | **Type**                   | **Role**      |
| subject          | String                     | Partition key |
| credential_id    | String (UUID)              | Sort key      |
| issue_date       | String (ISO 8601)          | Attribute     |
| expiry_date      | String (ISO 8601)          | Attribute     |
| revocation_index | Number                     | Attribute     |
| status           | String (ACTIVE or REVOKED) | Attribute     |

The relationship between a pseudonymous user identity and their
credentials is 1:N. One partition key groups all credential records ever
issued to that user under that IdP. Each individual credential is
uniquely identified by cred_id as the sort key, meaning new issuance
after revocation or expiry produces a new record rather than overwriting
the old one.

The Issuance Lambda never touches the bitstring. It only queries the
Credential table: if any record exists under the partition key with
status = ACTIVE and expiry_date \> now, the request is rejected, since
the user can only have one active credential from a given IdP. Otherwise
a new record is written with a freshly generated cred_id.

### System Architecture

ZeroVerify’s architecture is split into two completely independent
paths: issuance and verification. The backend is only involved in
issuance. Verification happens entirely between the user’s browser and
the verifier, with ZeroVerify’s backend never seeing what is being
proved or to whom.

### Issuance Path

The user navigates to ZeroVerify’s React web app and initiates
credential issuance. The app redirects to Keycloak, which federates with
the user’s institutional Shibboleth IdP via SAML. From the user’s
perspective this is a standard OAuth login flow. Once authenticated,
Keycloak returns an authorization code to the React app. The app passes
this code to the Issuance Lambda via API Gateway. The Lambda exchanges
the code with Keycloak for a normalized OIDC claims set, computes
HMAC(issuer_id \|\| sub_id) using a key from AWS Secrets Manager,
queries DynamoDB to check whether an active unexpired credential already
exists for that pseudonymous identifier, and if not, signs a BBS+
verifiable credential to the React app. The credential is stored in the
browser’s IndexedDB and never transmitted to any server again.

### Verification Path

The verifier generates a URL containing the proof type, their callback
endpoint, and a nonce they generated themselves. The user opens this URL
in their browser, landing on ZeroVerify’s React web app. The app loads
the credential from IndexedDB, checks whether a valid active credential
exists for the requested proof type, and presents a consent screen
showing exactly what is being requested and by whom. If the user
consents, the app generates a Groth16 zk-SNARK proof client-side using
snarkjs. The proof is posted directly to the verifier’s callback
endpoint. ZeroVerify’s backend is not involved at any point in the
verification path.

The verifier independently downloads ZeroVerify’s W3C Revocation Bit
String to check credentials revocation status. Both the verification key
and the bitstring are public artifacts served statically. The verifier
needs no API integration with ZeroVerify beyond these two static
resources.

### Revocation Path

Revocation requests are submitted to the SQS Queue via API Gateway.
Those requests are processed in batches by the Revocation Lambda. The
Lambda updates the credential record’s status to REVOKED in DynamoDB.
Lambda downloads the bitstring from the S3 and updates the values and
uploads it back.

### Component interaction

The React app talks to API Gateway over HTTPS for issuance and
revocation only. It talks directly to the verifier’s callback endpoint
for proof submission.

### Integration Strategy

### Identity Providers (via Keycloak)

ZeroVerify integrates with institutional identity providers through
Keycloak as the federation layer. Keycloak handles all SAML complexity
internally. From ZeroVerify’s perspective, every IdP looks identical: a
standard OIDC claims set returned after an authorization code exchange.
Adding a new institution requires only configuring a new IdP in
Keycloak’s realm.

### Verifier Callback Endpoint

The React app receives the verifier’s callback URL as a query parameter
in the verification link and posts the generated proof directly to it
over HTTPS. ZeroVerify imposes no requirements on the verifier’s backend
beyond accepting an HTTP POST with the proof payload.
