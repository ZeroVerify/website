Privacy-Preserving Verification System

## The Hook (The "Why Now")

Attribute verification is broken across markets: the student discount
market _[$19.3 billion by
2033](https://growthmarketreports.com/report/student-discount-platforms-market)_,
age verification ($1.2B by 2028), employment verification for corporate
benefits. People surrender excessive personal data to prove simple
facts. For a $5 Spotify discount, students upload driver’s licenses to
_[SheerID](https://www.sheerid.com/)_, full name, birthdate, address,
photo, stored in centralized databases. Seniors proving age eligibility,
employees accessing corporate perks, professionals showing licensure all
face the same problem: verification requires exposing identity data that
services don’t need. Apple’s Digital ID and the EU’s May 2024 regulation
requiring zero-knowledge proofs validate that better verification is
possible. The timing is right: growing markets, clear privacy problem,
proven technology.

## The Problem (The Gap)

The market has a gap.
_[SheerID](https://www.vendr.com/buyer-guides/sheerid)_ gives merchants
real-time verification but collects excessive data: IP addresses, device
IDs, blocks VPNs. _[Apple’s Digital
ID](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/apple-introduces-digital-id-a-new-way-to-create-and-present-an-id-in-apple-wallet/)_
uses selective disclosure, which shows merchants some real identity data
(actual birthdate, university name, employer) but hides other fields.
Merchants still receive enough information to track and profile users
across services.

**Target Users**: Primary users are individuals proving attributes
(students, employees, seniors, veterans, licensed professionals) who
want verification without exposing personal data. Secondary stakeholders
are service providers integrating our API to verify attributes without
storing personal data, and credential issuers (universities, employers,
agencies, licensing boards) who use OAuth to let us issue credentials
after authentication, offloading verification infrastructure while
remaining the source of truth.

## The Solution: ZeroVerify

ZeroVerify uses zero-knowledge proofs for attribute verification without
data disclosure. Here’s how it works:

1.  User authenticates with credential issuer via OAuth (university for
    enrollment, employer for employment status, government agency for
    age/veteran status, licensing board for professional credentials)

2.  Our service creates a signed credential and sends it directly to the
    user’s browser

3.  User stores the credential encrypted in a browser wallet

4.  When verification is needed, the wallet generates a mathematical
    proof

5.  Merchant receives the proof and verifies it; learns only “this
    person has an attribute X”

The merchant never sees your name, university, graduation date, or any
personal information. The credential stays on your device. Only the
proof gets sent.

## Technical Approach & Depth

- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript/React browser wallet (web-based, works on
  any modern browser across Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS),
  serverless backend using AWS Lambda functions with Terraform for
  infrastructure, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3, AWS API Gateway, BSS+
  signatures.

- **Cryptographic Complexity:** We use zero-knowledge SNARKs implemented
  with **[Circom](https://docs.circom.io/)** circuits that compile to
  WebAssembly. The browser generates proofs using
  **[snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)**. The proof
  demonstrates “I have a valid credential from an accredited university
  AND it hasn’t expired” without revealing the actual credential data.

- **Engineering Merit:** We use **[W3C Verifiable Credentials
  2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/)** and OAuth/OIDC to
  support any identity provider, eliminating the need for bilateral
  agreements.

- **Technical Superiority**: We use zkSNARKs over Bulletproofs because
  SNARKs produce constant-size proofs **[(~200
  bytes)](https://alinush.github.io/groth16)** regardless of statement
  complexity. Bulletproofs scale logarithmically with circuit size. For
  merchant verification, constant proof size means predictable
  bandwidth. SNARK verification is O(1), Bulletproof verification is
  O(n). The tradeoff is trusted setup, mitigated through multi-party
  computation with public transcripts. We chose W3C Bitstring Status
  Lists over OCSP for privacy-preserving revocation. OCSP requires
  querying a server with the credential ID, revealing which credential
  is being verified. Bitstrings allow merchants to download a compact
  list ( 1KB for 10,000 credentials) and check revocation locally
  without revealing which credential they’re verifying. We chose BBS+
  signatures over ECDSA for selective disclosure. ECDSA requires the
  entire credential in the ZK circuit to prove any attribute. BBS+
  proves only required attributes (e.g., enrollment status) without
  processing unnecessary fields, reducing circuit complexity.

## Novelty & USP (Unique Selling Point)

Our USP is zero-knowledge verification. Proof without any data
disclosure. Unlike SheerID’s database matching or Apple’s selective
disclosure (which reveals actual attribute values to verifiers), we
expose nothing. The proof demonstrates a valid attribute (e.g.,
“currently enrolled”, “over 21”, “licensed professional”) without
revealing the underlying data.

Unlike Apple’s Digital ID (iOS-only, requires Apple API integration) or
institution-specific solutions (require bilateral agreements), we’re
web-based and cross-platform. The wallet runs in any modern browser on
any device. ZK proofs work across web, mobile, desktop with standard
HTTP APIs.

## Broader Impact

- **Economic:** Users stop surrendering identity documents for routine
  verifications like discounts, benefits, or service access.

- **Legal/Regulatory:** GDPR and CCPA both require data minimization. We
  collect less data than SheerID, so we’re compliant by design. The EU
  passed a digital identity regulation in May 2024 that requires
  zero-knowledge proofs, which validates our technical approach and
  might influence future U.S. privacy laws.

- **Technological:** Proves browser-based ZK cryptography works for
  consumers. Extends to any attribute verification (age, employment,
  licensure) where proof without disclosure is valuable.
